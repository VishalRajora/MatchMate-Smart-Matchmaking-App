# MatchMate-Smart-Matchmaking-App
MatchMate is a modern Android matchmaking app that fetches random user profiles via the Random User API, allowing users to accept or decline matches. It features robust offline support, local persistence using Room, flaky network simulation with retry handling, and a custom match score algorithm based on user attributes.
